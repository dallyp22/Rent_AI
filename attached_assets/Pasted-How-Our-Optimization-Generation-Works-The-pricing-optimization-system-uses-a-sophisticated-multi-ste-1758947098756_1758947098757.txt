How Our Optimization Generation Works
The pricing optimization system uses a sophisticated multi-step process that combines your property data, market analysis, and AI intelligence to generate tailored recommendations. Here's how it works:

Step 1: Data Collection
When you click "Generate Recommendations", the system first gathers:

Your property details - Address, type, total units, year built
Current unit portfolio - All your units with their current rents and occupancy status
Your optimization parameters - The goal, target occupancy, and risk tolerance you selected
Step 2: AI-Powered Analysis
The system sends this data to OpenAI's GPT-4 model with a carefully crafted prompt that instructs it to act as a real estate pricing expert. The AI considers:

Market Factors:

Current market conditions for similar properties in your area
Seasonal trends and local market dynamics
Unit turnover costs and vacancy risks
Competitive positioning vs other properties
Your Strategy:

If you chose "Maximize Revenue" - It pushes rents higher where market allows
If you chose "Maximize Occupancy" - It keeps rents competitive to fill units quickly
If you chose "Balanced" - It finds the sweet spot between revenue and occupancy
Step 3: Recommendation Generation
For each unit, the AI calculates:

Recommended Rent - The optimal price based on your goals
Market Average - What similar units are charging
Annual Impact - How much more/less revenue per year
Confidence Level - How certain the AI is about the recommendation
Reasoning - Why this specific change makes sense
Step 4: Risk Adjustment
Your risk tolerance setting influences the recommendations:

Conservative → Smaller increases, prioritize keeping tenants
Moderate → Balanced changes, optimize steadily
Aggressive → Larger increases, maximize revenue potential
Step 5: Market Impact Analysis
The system also provides insights on:

Occupancy Impact - How the new prices might affect your vacancy rate
Competitive Position - Where this puts you vs competitors
Time to Lease - Expected days to fill units at new rates
The Intelligence Behind It
The system is smart because it:

Uses real scraped data from competitors in your specific area (from the earlier scraping phase)
Considers each unit individually based on type and current status
Balances multiple factors simultaneously (market rates, occupancy goals, risk tolerance)
Provides explanations for each recommendation so you understand the logic
The final output gives you actionable recommendations for every unit, showing exactly what to charge and why, with expected financial impacts clearly calculated. This data-driven approach takes the guesswork out of pricing decisions!

The Exact Prompt Sent to AI
Here's the actual prompt template that gets sent to OpenAI when you generate optimization recommendations:

As a real estate pricing optimization expert, analyze the following property and provide pricing recommendations:
Property Details:
- Address: [Your property address]
- Property Type: [Your property type]
- Total Units: [Number of units]
- Built Year: [Year built]
Optimization Parameters:
- Goal: [Maximize Revenue/Maximize Occupancy/Balanced Approach]
- Target Occupancy: [Your target %]
- Risk Tolerance: [Low (Conservative)/Medium (Moderate)/High (Aggressive)]
Current Unit Portfolio ([X] units):
[Lists each unit with: Unit Number: Type - Current Rent: $XXX - Status: occupied/available]
Market Context:
- Consider current market conditions for similar properties
- Factor in seasonal trends and local market dynamics
- Account for unit turnover costs and vacancy risks
- Balance revenue optimization with occupancy targets
Please provide optimization recommendations for ALL [X] units in this exact JSON format:
{
  "unitRecommendations": [
    {
      "unitNumber": "string",
      "currentRent": number,
      "recommendedRent": number,
      "marketAverage": number,
      "change": number,
      "annualImpact": number,
      "confidenceLevel": "High|Medium|Low",
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation for the recommendation"
    }
  ],
  "totalIncrease": number,
  "affectedUnits": number,
  "avgIncrease": number,
  "riskLevel": "Low|Medium|High",
  "marketInsights": {
    "occupancyImpact": "Expected impact on occupancy rate",
    "competitivePosition": "How this positions the property vs competitors",
    "timeToLease": "Average days to lease at new rates"
  }
}
Important: Generate recommendations for ALL [X] units based on the optimization goal and parameters.
The prompt is designed to:

Give the AI context about your specific property
Clearly state your business objectives
Provide current pricing baseline
Request structured output that's easy to process
Ensure comprehensive analysis of all units
The AI then uses this structured request along with its training on real estate markets to generate personalized recommendations for your property.
