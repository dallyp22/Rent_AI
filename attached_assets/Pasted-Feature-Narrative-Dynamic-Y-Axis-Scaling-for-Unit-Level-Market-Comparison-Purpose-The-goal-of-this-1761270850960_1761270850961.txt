Feature Narrative: Dynamic Y-Axis Scaling for Unit-Level Market Comparison
Purpose

The goal of this feature is to make the Unit-Level Market Comparison chart visually communicate meaningful pricing differences between our units and competitor properties.
Rather than showing an equalized range that flattens variation, the Y-axis should dynamically zoom into the active data range — allowing viewers to instantly perceive where we lead, lag, or align in the market.

User Story

As a portfolio manager or analyst,
I want the chart to automatically adjust its Y-axis scale based on the range of unit prices displayed,
so that I can immediately see how our rents compare to competitors without losing clarity or overemphasizing extremes.

Behavioral Narrative

When the user loads the Unit-Level Market Comparison view:

The system reads all active rent data points (both our units and competitors).

It determines the minimum and maximum rent values currently visible.

The Y-axis dynamically adjusts to a focused range — slightly below the lowest value and slightly above the highest (typically ±5–10%).

This creates a zoomed-in frame where even modest price differences appear visually meaningful.

If the dataset expands (e.g., more units added, or competitor data changes), the Y-axis auto-rescales to maintain this relationship without manual updates.

UX Intent

The chart should visually emphasize competitive positioning without misrepresenting data.

Small but material rent differences ($100–$300) should be clearly visible.

The visual frame should always “feel” balanced — not clipped or exaggerated.

Users should intuitively understand where their property sits in the market at a glance.

Design Logic
Step	Logic	Example
1	Detect dataset min/max	min = $950, max = $1,450
2	Apply buffer	lower bound = min × 0.95 → $902.5; upper bound = max × 1.05 → $1,522.5
3	Render dynamic axis domain	domain={[dataMin => dataMin * 0.95, dataMax => dataMax * 1.05]}
4	Format axis labels	$1,000, $1,200, $1,400
5	Auto-adjust on dataset change	When new data is loaded, recompute range before rendering.
