Complete Optimization Strategy Specifications
1. Maximize Revenue Strategy
Goal: Optimize for highest possible revenue while maintaining acceptable occupancy
Parameters:

Target Occupancy: 85%
Risk Level: 3 (Aggressive)
Primary Metric: Annual Revenue Impact

AI Prompt Guidelines:
OPTIMIZATION GOAL: MAXIMIZE REVENUE

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Maximize rental revenue across the portfolio
TARGET OCCUPANCY: 85% (willing to accept some vacancy for higher rents)
PRICING STRATEGY: Aggressive - pursue premium pricing where market supports it
RISK TOLERANCE: Level 3 (substantial changes acceptable)

PRICING RULES:
1. Recommend price increases when:
   - Unit is priced below market average (any amount)
   - Competition exists and property has competitive advantages (location, amenities, condition)
   - Historical occupancy for unit type is >85%
   - Market shows ability to absorb higher prices

2. Magnitude of increases:
   - Strong market position: Up to 10-15% increases
   - Average market position: 5-10% increases
   - Weak market position: 2-5% increases

3. Recommend price decreases ONLY when:
   - Unit has been vacant >60 days
   - Unit is priced >20% above market average
   - Occupancy for that unit type is <70%
   - Decrease would generate faster lease-up with better annual revenue

4. Unit-type competition analysis:
   - If NO competition exists for unit type: Allow 15-20% premium over similar sized units
   - If LIMITED competition (<3 competitors): Allow 10-15% premium
   - If STRONG competition (>5 competitors): Stay within 5% of market average

5. Consider turnover costs:
   - Vacant units should prioritize lease-up after 45 days
   - Balance higher rents against extended vacancy costs
   - Factor in $1,500-2,500 turnover costs per unit

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- HIGH confidence: Strong market data, clear competitive position, recent comps
- MEDIUM confidence: Limited market data, unclear trends, older comps
- LOW confidence: Minimal market data, unique unit types, volatile market

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
For each unit provide:
- Recommended rent (specific dollar amount)
- Change from current rent (dollar and percentage)
- Annual impact calculation
- Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
- Reasoning (2-3 sentences explaining the recommendation)

2. Maximize Occupancy Strategy
Goal: Achieve highest possible occupancy with competitive pricing
Parameters:

Target Occupancy: 98%
Risk Level: 1 (Conservative)
Primary Metric: Occupancy Rate & Lease-Up Speed

AI Prompt Guidelines:
OPTIMIZATION GOAL: MAXIMIZE OCCUPANCY

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Achieve and maintain 98% occupancy
TARGET OCCUPANCY: 98% (prioritize keeping units filled)
PRICING STRATEGY: Conservative - competitive pricing to attract and retain tenants
RISK TOLERANCE: Level 1 (minimal changes, stability preferred)

PRICING RULES:
1. Default approach - FAVOR DECREASES OR MINIMAL CHANGES:
   - Occupied units: Recommend <3% increases maximum
   - Vacant units: Recommend decreases to accelerate lease-up

2. Recommend price INCREASES only when ALL conditions met:
   - Unit is significantly underpriced (>15% below market average)
   - AND no direct competition exists for that unit type
   - AND current occupancy for that unit type is >95%
   - AND increase is <5%

3. Recommend price DECREASES when:
   - Unit has been vacant >30 days: 3-5% decrease
   - Unit has been vacant >45 days: 5-8% decrease
   - Unit has been vacant >60 days: 8-12% decrease
   - Unit is priced above market average (any amount): Match or go 2-3% below market
   - Occupancy for unit type is <92%: Decrease to market average or below

4. Pricing positioning:
   - TARGET: 5-10% below market average for fastest lease-up
   - Never price above market average unless no competition exists
   - For competitive unit types: Match lowest competitor or go 2-3% below

5. Unit-type competition analysis:
   - If NO competition for unit type: Can price at market average (no premium)
   - If LIMITED competition: Price at or slightly below average
   - If STRONG competition: Price 5-10% below average for competitive advantage

6. Seasonal adjustments:
   - Peak season (May-August): Can be less aggressive with decreases
   - Off-season (Nov-Feb): Be more aggressive with competitive pricing
   - Consider local market timing

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- HIGH confidence: Recent comparable leases, clear market positioning

3. Balanced Strategy
Goal: Optimize for both revenue and occupancy in equilibrium
Parameters:

Target Occupancy: 92%
Risk Level: 2 (Moderate)
Primary Metric: Revenue per Available Unit (RevPAU)

AI Prompt Guidelines:
OPTIMIZATION GOAL: BALANCED APPROACH

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Balance revenue optimization with strong occupancy
TARGET OCCUPANCY: 92% (optimal economic occupancy)
PRICING STRATEGY: Moderate - strategic pricing based on market position
RISK TOLERANCE: Level 2 (moderate changes, calculated risk)

PRICING PHILOSOPHY:
Revenue Per Available Unit (RevPAU) = Average Rent × Occupancy Rate
Optimize this formula by finding the sweet spot between rent and occupancy

PRICING RULES:
1. Recommend price INCREASES when:
   - Unit is underpriced (>10% below market average)
   - Unit type occupancy is >90%
   - Property has competitive advantages (location, condition, amenities)
   - Increase magnitude: 5-8% maximum

2. Recommend price DECREASES when:
   - Unit has been vacant >45 days: 5-7% decrease
   - Unit is overpriced (>10% above market average): Match market
   - Unit type occupancy is <85%: Decrease 3-5%
   - Revenue loss from vacancy exceeds revenue gain from higher rent

3. MAINTAIN current pricing when:
   - Unit is within ±10% of market average
   - Unit type occupancy is 88-95%
   - Recent lease-up was within acceptable timeframe (30-45 days)
   - No significant market changes detected

4. Unit-type competition analysis:
   - NO competition: Allow 5-10% premium over market average
   - LIMITED competition: Match market average or 2-3% premium
   - STRONG competition: Match market average or 0-5% below if needed

5. Economic occupancy analysis:
   For each recommendation calculate:
   - Current annual revenue: Current Rent × Expected Occupancy Days
   - Proposed annual revenue: New Rent × Expected Occupancy Days
   - Only recommend changes that improve annual revenue

6. Market timing considerations:
   - Consider seasonal demand patterns
   - Account for local market velocity
   - Factor in upcoming lease expirations and renewal timing

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- HIGH confidence: Strong data supporting RevPAU improvement

Portfolio-level provide:
- Total RevPAU improvement
- Number of increases vs decreases vs no changes
- Average percentage change
- Projected occupancy rate
- Total annual revenue impact
